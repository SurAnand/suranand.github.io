  Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. I use this space to keep my thoughts that I consider are reusable.
</p>

There is nothing yet anything concrete about my profile. But in short, I have been learning a lot of technical stuff these days. Most of it has been a journey in solitude which I have nothing to complain about. It has its own set of pluses. But without a peer, the chance of getting lost is pretty high. And moreover, the technical skills I am trying to acquire are subjects like programming languages, data concepts, analytics, etc. Grouping all of them, I am actually trying to achieve quite a bit of sophisticated computational applications, such as Data Science. This is a field where journey withough a peer is riskier. So I try to keep my thoughts, processes, experiences here so once could correct me when they find anything worth, one could use if found useful.

It gives me a sense of, **I am not alone**.

I try things at [GitHub](https://github.com/suranand) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suranands).

Thanks for reading!
