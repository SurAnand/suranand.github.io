  I try many things. I try to write as well.
</p>

I keep learning multiple things simultaneously. Obviously, not as a choice. Every moment gives either an opportunity or a compulsion to learn something new. People classify subjects into technical and non-technical. I am not sure I understand that strategy. Each subject is technical for the person whose daily routine is in that subject and he or she knows in and out of that subject. So I learn topics no matter whether they are technical or not. 

Some of them include - data privacy, cloud security, pentesting (yes, why not!), enterprise data management, etc. And I am fanatic of Linux, python and markdown syntax. So I love trying new things with these. Recently, data privacy has been a challenging experience. It gives me an opportunity to figure how clickly I am capable of catching the hidden legal meaning of these laws. Try compliance if you want to see how many ways something can be interpreted by different mindsets. 

I can clearly see some patterns in terms what I am expected to achieve out of learning all this. Most probably, I'll end up in some managerial role. Because, this path is surely for the Jack of all trades, and Master of none. I have no regrets. I get easily bored if you keep me in one discussion for too long. That's just me ;-)

Most of my learning has been a journey in solitude which I have nothing to complain about. It has its own set of pluses. But without a peer, the chance of getting lost is pretty high. So I try to keep my thoughts, opinions and experiences here so someone would correct me when they find something wrong, or someone could use if they find it useful (those like me).

It gives me a sense of, **I am not alone**.

Thanks to those who take time to correct me!!
