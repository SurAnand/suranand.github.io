# Shall we take a look at what IPython NoteBook is....?

I lost my mind when I first learned it. I was so mesmerized and lost in this (I)Python world. I just told you about my awe about IPython. But if you get a chance to learn IPython Notebook, you will go dumb-struck.

## It's magic.

Try these steps! For fun but motivational.

Go to this link. [http://nbviewer.ipython.org/](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)

It looks like a google search engine. In the search box, paste this link now, `https://gist.github.com/asmind/8667c570b20ecae8f50d`

And ... Voila!

See what it is? That's my new IPython Notebook I created while learning. It is such a magic. You know what all I needed to do?

First launch an **IPython Notebook** session from `terminal` using `ipython notebook --pylab` from the directory of my choice.

The `--pylab` imports a python library called **PyLab** and keeps ready for you almost all the packages sufficient for some serious scientific computing, including `matplotlib`. Learn what `matplotlib` is [on this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib).

The command above launches a web browser where the new IPython Notebook appears, whose address bar is a local address. Click on the `NEW` button on the right, it creates a new notebook.

Do whatever you want to do in it including writing `python code`, writing `markdown` docs, executing normal `terminal` commands, etc and it is autosaved. Give a title on top (click on UNTITLED on top). Autosaved again!

Close it!

Go to the folder where it saved this file as Ex: IPy Intro.ipynb

Double click and it opens in `gedit`. This is actually a JSON file (I am yet to learn this part though, that doesn't stop me from writing). Paste the entire content of this file in [http://gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com)

Now Create a Public or Private Gist (see the options below the box where you pasted your text). This creates a **_Git Gist_** link which is what I shared above. This JSON file when you open it in the way I showed above (before Voila), opens like an IPython Notebook. This way, any number of people can collaborate on this work. Isn't this magic?

IPython, my latest love!

This is it for now. I am losing my mind.....
