## Of Misleading Mind.

#### Written 30 Oct 2013

These are my mental vibrations after I read a recent article that says, "Mind misleads."

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. - Einstein.

If only looks could kill...your eyes deceive you!. Minds Mislead Us!

What do you think this stuff is? Do you really think so? Or, don't you really think so?

Let me try!

I have heard somewhere. The colors that we can see through our eyes, are not visible to cows. They can only see black and white. Who is mislead now, cows or us, about the reality?

This is like a paradox. Everything is, perhaps!

I strongly think there is a set of opposite minds in all our (human) brains. One wants you to do and the other wants you not.

Without introducing this complexity, there seems to be no better way of simplifying the fact, mind misleads you. But I take it anyway.

There is another catch to it. When we say our mind misleads us, we are essentially claiming that we are fully aware of what is leading and what is otherwise. Or what is right and what is not. And also, leading in which direction and misleading in which one. Are we, really?

What about the problem of left and right brains? Is this what I was unconsciously reinforcing in my first couple of thoughts in this scribble, the opposite minds in a brain? Ultimately, it all boils down to what exactly is misleading?

I wish I were a neuroscientist, I could have cracked it by now with the sort amusement I find in knowing things like this about mind. But who knows, perhaps all neuroscientists are already mislead, do they know? And they focus on those micro, really micro, things that layman has no interest in. After all, who is interested in how a mind works, when none of us have ever seen whether it exists in reality?

Yeah, I am talking sense. I mean, why do we always struggle with understanding mind, when we could have spent that time and energy in understanding brain which physically existing? Mind and soul are two concepts people should avoid blabbering on. See, I am already misleading a huge bunch of people with my baseless thoughts. But'. I don't know.

Oh right, this is probably why we got scholars like Karl Popper, Wittgenstein, etc. We always have to accept that we are like stuck in the maze of language. We are stuck with words, in a way, perceptions. What we think we know is what we actually perceive that we know. Ehem, I am sorry, I actually started this out to bring in some funny science, but it all ended up in some sort of philosophy. Not too far though, science and philosophy, are they?

I am not trying to create or support some elegant, meta-exploration theories. But I am just saying, are we really sure of what we always say when we say, some mind is right and some other is not. I don't want to spoil the grace and virtue of being able to contemplate on such powerful ideas, by simply giving you answers to all the questions I shot at you here, ruthlessly. (Ehem' I actually don't know any answer, but that's a secret, I don't want to share it with anybody! ;-)) Alright, we may have to explore the possibility of hunting that mind thing down somewhere and rip open it to see what it consists of and the machinery and mechanisms inside. Let us hope we will soon have a scientist who has the know-how of this highly analytical experiment.

See you next time with something more meaningless!
