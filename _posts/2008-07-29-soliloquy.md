#### Written on 29 Jul 2008

In the silence of a night, in the blissful mood,

Whenever I look into the heavens and I hear the stars speak

Sometimes with each other, sometimes with me.

Then I believe an audience is never in need

And I may recite a poem!
<hr></hr>
In the evening of a hazy and misty sky,

Whenever it rains, I listen to the songs sung by raindrops

Sometimes individually, sometimes in chorus.

Then I believe an audience is never in need

And I may recite a poem!
<hr></hr>
In the span before the dawn, in every fortuitous acquaintance,

Whenever I see Venus and express my enigma about 'love'

Sometimes she smiles at me, sometimes refutes my mind.

Then I believe an audience is never in need

And I may recite a poem!
<hr></hr>
In every momentous argument and every trifling conversation,

Whenever my friend says how my character must be more comprehensible

Sometimes to the world, sometimes to myself

Even then I believe an audience is never in need

And I may recite a poem!
<hr></hr>
But..........
<hr></hr>
In every breath one takes, every time of the unforeseen life,

Whenever I could find the human race at an unimaginable extent

That one could say, "the world has no countries,

Men have no religions,

One needs no ruler and no rules,

Women are no more meretricious but are

Either wives or mothers or pure lovers,

There are no more demons and demagogues,

No more knives and rifles, no guillotines and bombs,

No such vocabulary at all in use,

No more revolutions and politicos,

Whenever the sound of peace resounds alone

And only the tears of happiness are felt everywhere

In all the corners of the world, in every story untold,
<hr></hr>
Oh boy of such an era,

I pity you for you can never recite a poem,

As the history of the world of this kind itself will be

An ode of exalted emotions and elevated principles

And the life of every audience will be an ineffable poem!
