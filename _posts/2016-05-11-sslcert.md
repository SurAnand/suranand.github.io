title: Add SSL Certificates to your website

> ;-) Sort of a Disclaimer: This post does not (none of my posts, for that matter) mean that I am an authority in this domain of technology. I am learning and just sharing here so somebody might find time to point out the errors. But all the steps mentioned here worked just right for me to get an A on [SSL-Test of Qualsys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). Getting an ***A+*** requires thorough knowledge in `ssl_ciphers`, which I do not have. But there are more knowledgeable people who wrote several posts on getting A+.

I guess you are using *Apache* as your webserver and all the instructions are given based on that assumption.

## Step-1 | Collect SSL Certificates into the relevant directory

The vendor of SSL Certificates might have sent you a few certificate files usually with file extensions `.crt & .key`, perhaps all of them zipped. In this example, the certificates are coming from **[Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/)**.

Once you unzip this folder, you may see 5 things.

- A `.crt` file that looks similar to `AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt`
- A `.crt` file that looks similar to `USERTrust... or UTNRSACertificationAuthority.crt`
- A `.crt` file that looks similar to `NetworkSolutionsOVServerCA2.crt`
- A `.crt` file whose file name contains your target domain name such as `www.example.com`. In this example, the file name would be `WWW.EXAMPLE.COM.crt`
- A `.key` file which is your Certification Key File

Bring all these files into this path: `/etc/apache2/ssl/`
(Create `ssl` directory if you don't already have it: `sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl`.)

## Step-2 | Make ChainTxt File

Let us make a `chainfile.txt` in the same directory.

So let's go to that directory:

```sh
cd /etc/apache2/ssl
```

Create a file called `chainfile.txt`(use any editor of your choice):

```sh
sudo vi chainfile.txt`
```

Into this file, copy the contents of the following files in the **SAME EXACT ORDER**, and save and close it.

`AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt, UTNRSACertificationAuthority.crt & NetworkSolutionsOVServerCA2.crt`

## Step-3 | Configure the `default-ssl.conf`

Open this file:

```sh
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
```

Before our intervention, the file might look something like this, excluding all the comments (lines beginning with `#`):

```sh
 <VirtualHost _default_:80>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
```

After creating a backup of this file, change the content of this file that looks like below:

```sh
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost _default_:443>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

                SSLEngine on
                SSLCertificateFile   /etc/apache2/ssl/WWW.EXAMPLE.COM.crt
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/<your.key.file>
                SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl/chainfile.txt
                SSLCipherSuite ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA
                SSLHonorCipherOrder on
                SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
       </VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

## Step-4 | Configure the `example.com.conf`

This step is exactly what you did in the previous step except that you do the configuration entries in your website's conf file. For example, if your website is `www.example.com`, then you will find a conf file in your `sites-enabled` folder `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/`, with a filename that looks like `www.example.com.conf`. Make the same changes in this file as you did in the previous step.

## Step-5 | Enable Apache SSL Module & Restart Apache

Run the following commands:

```sh
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo service apache2 restart
```

This finishes the process of installing SSL certificates in your site. However, if everything went fine, you need to get at least an ***A*** on the [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) website. I hope you get it. If you don't, please leave a comment here to help me learn my mistakes.
