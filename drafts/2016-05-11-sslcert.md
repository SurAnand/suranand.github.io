# Add SSL Certificates to your website

> Sort of a Disclaimer: This is not written by an authority in this domain of technology. I am learning and just sharing here so somebody might find time to point out the errors. But all the steps mentioned here worked just right for me to get an A on [SSL-Test of Qualsys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). More knowledge is necessary for getting an A+.

This document assumes that you are using *Apache* as your webserver and all the instructions are given based on that assumption.

The second reference in the above list is used because our SSL certificates are from this company, therefore this serves as the official documentation.

## Step-1 | Collect SSL Certificates into the relevant directory

The vendor of SSL Certificates might have sent you a few certificate files usually file extensions `.crt & .key`, perhaps all of them zipped. In this example, the certificates are coming from **[Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/)**.

Once you unzip this folder, you may see 5 things.

- A `.crt` file that looks similar to `AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt`
- A `.crt` file that looks similar to `USERTrust... or UTNRSACertificationAuthority.crt`
- A `.crt` file that looks similar to `NetworkSolutionsOVServerCA2.crt`
- A `.crt` file whose file name contains your target domain name such as `www.example.com`. In this example, the file name would be `WWW.EXAMPLE.COM.crt`
- A `.key` file which is your Certification Key File

Bring all these files into this path: `/etc/apache2/ssl/`
(Create `ssl` directory if you don't already have it: `sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl`.)

## Step-2 | Make ChainTxt File

Let us make a `chainfile.txt` in the same directory.

So go to that directory:
```
cd /etc/apache2/ssl
```

Create a file named `chainfile.txt`(use any editor of your choice):
```
sudo vi chainfile.txt`
```

Into this file, copy the contents of the following files in the **SAME EXACT ORDER**, and save and close it.

`AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt, UTNRSACertificationAuthority.crt & NetworkSolutionsOVServerCA2.crt`

## Step-3 | Configure the `default-ssl.conf`

Open this file:

```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
```

Before our intervention, the file might look something like this, excluding all the comments (lines beginning with `#`):

```
 <VirtualHost _default_:80>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
```

After creating a backup of this file, change the content of this file that looks like below:

```
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost _default_:443>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

                SSLEngine on
                SSLCertificateFile   /etc/apache2/ssl/WWW.EXAMPLE.COM.crt
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/<your.key.file>
                SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl/chainfile.txt
                SSLCipherSuite ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA
                SSLHonorCipherOrder on
                SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
       </VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

## Step-4 | Configure the `example.com.conf`

## Step-5 | Enable Apache SSL Module & Restart Apache

Run the following commands:
```
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## Step-6 | Testing your SSL Certification Installation

Use https://www.ssllabs.com/
